# YOLO_research
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and scripts for exploring and training various versions of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model. The primary goal is to document and share the knowledge gained while working with different YOLO models, including YOLOv1, YOLOv2, and YOLOv3. The notebooks are designed to be in Colab.
